# RELICS PMT test data analysis

## Guide
To install the package, run the following command in terminal:

``` git clone git@github.com:Westlake-University-Lsc-lab/RELICS_PMT_Data_Analysis.git ```

``` cd PolariserCheck ```

``` git checkout (branch_name) ```

## Experiment
The setup of the experiment is shown in the 
![box diagram](https://github.com/Chocolirz/RELICS_PMT_Data_Analysis/blob/main/img/experiment_setup.pdf).

## Calibrations
### Dark rate
Dark rate is tested every time HV is applied. A reasonable range is several hundreds of Hertz. 

### Polariser transmission ratio
Data is stored in the laboratory's server, analysised by ![this notebook](https://github.com/Chocolirz/RELICS_PMT_Data_Analysis/blob/main/PolariserCheck/check_readout.ipynb).

### Linearity
To find out the minimum energy for saturation, we tested the linearity of our PMT by comparing the pulse area of two PMTs. 

Data was analysised by 
## Tests
### Time constant of recharge
### Dynode readout
