# Time Constant Measurement

This directory contains the code for measuring the time constant of a PMT.

## Background

The time constant refers to the time required for the PMT to de-saturate after a big S1 pulse. It is measured by observing the simulated S2 pattern shortly after a simulated S1. In the RELICS experiment, the typical energy scale of S1 is $50\ {\rm PE/ns}, $64\ {\rm ns}$; S2 is $0\sim 5\ {\rm PE/ns}$, time scale depends on the drift velocity of electrons, i.e. the magnitude of drift $E$ field. The expected order of magnitude is $10^{-7}~10^{-6}\ {\rm s}$. 

## Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:
